# BranchWise-Pro-Optimizing-Decision-Trees
ranchWise Pro is a robust machine learning project that explores the full lifecycle of Decision Tree Classification, enhanced by both Pre-Pruning and Post-Pruning techniques. Built in Python, this project demonstrates how to control tree complexity before and after training to improve accuracy, reduce overfitting, and maintain interpretability.
